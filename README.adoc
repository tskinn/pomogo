= Use Cases

== Normal

. user enters `task start <id>` -- hooks fire
.. taskw hooks fire
... timew hook fires starting time tracking 
... pomo hook fires trigging a pomo session
. 25 minutes pass
. pomo completes session
.. pomo hooks fire
... increment successive session count
... stop task <id> `task stop <id>`
... notify user or extension?
... modify task <id> increment pomodoro count
.... get pomodoro count `task <id> export` get json output
.... increment and set count `task <id> modify pomodoro:<count>`
... setup new timer with hooks
... start new timer
. 5 minutes pass
. pomo completes session
.. pomo hooks fire
... notify user or extension maybe?
... start task: `task start <id>`

= Notes

== Six steps for pomodoro from wikipedia
. Decide on the task to be done.
. Set the timer.
. Work on the task.
. End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.
. If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3-5 minutes), then go to step 2.
. After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.

== how should we store "checkmarks"
* store info about previous checkmark
* either in memory or in a file
* check last info on last checkmark every session completion
** if last checkmark happened over a couple hours ago or something like that then lets start our checkmarks over
** if last checkmark was the 4th checkmark, reset checkmark counter
** checkmark: { "time": "2018-10-31:123:213123123", "count": 4, "user": "iuser", "task": "UUID" }
** task maybe optional doesn't really matter
* how would it work with multiple sessions happening?
* implement users? a user can only have one session at a time
* I guess this is more server oriented way to do it

== hook logic
. don't modify json just print out new
. if start exists in new and doesn't exist on old then START
. if start doesn't exist in new and exists in old then STOP
. if start exists in new and new status is not pending then STOP
